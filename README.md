# FoxOnTheRun
Source from the "Fox on the Run" 2011 Southwest Fox Session, which demonstrated how to use a Phonegap-enhanced web app make calls into a Visual FoxPro application. 

There are 2 folders of source code:

Web: These HTML files go into your IIS subfolder
App: These are compiled, along with the <a href="https://www.west-wind.com" target=_Blank>West Wind Web Connection</a>, into your executable.
